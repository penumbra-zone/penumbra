/// A well-typed wrapper around the GRPC custody protocol that uses Rust domain types rather than proto types.
///
/// The custody protocol is used by a wallet client to request authorization for
/// a transaction they’ve constructed.
///
/// Modeling transaction authorization as an asynchronous RPC call encourages
/// software to be written in a way that has a compatible data flow with a “soft
/// HSM”, threshold signing, a hardware wallet, etc.
///
/// The custody protocol does not trust the client to authorize spends, so
/// custody requests must contain sufficient information for the custodian to
/// understand the transaction and determine whether or not it should be
/// authorized.
///
/// This trait is a wrapper around the proto-generated [`CustodyServiceClient`] that serves two goals:
///
/// 1. It works on domain types rather than proto-generated types, avoiding conversions;
/// 2. It's easier to write as a trait bound than the `CustodyServiceClient`,
///   which requires complex bounds on its inner type to enforce that it is a
///   tower `Service`

    /// Requests authorization of the transaction with the given description.
