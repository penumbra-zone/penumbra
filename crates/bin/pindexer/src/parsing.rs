Error: using an upgrade genesis file instead of an initial genesis file.

This genesis file only contains a checkpoint hash of the state,
rather than information about how the initial state of the chain was initialized,
at the very first genesis.

Make sure that you're using the very first genesis file, before any upgrades.
