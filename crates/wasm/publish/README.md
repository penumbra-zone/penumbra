# Penumbra Typescript Wasm Helpers

This npm package is designed for Typescript/Javascript consumers to be able to
use Rust functionality via .wasm.

```bash
# Install wasm-pack first: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/

npm install
npm run publish-wasm-bundle
```

We have a release github action that runs these on every release.
