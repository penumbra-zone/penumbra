## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To understand this material, you should have:

**Required:**
- ‚úÖ Basic Rust knowledge
- ‚úÖ Understanding of public/private key cryptography
- ‚úÖ Willingness to learn!

**Helpful but not required:**
- ‚≠ê Basic understanding of elliptic curves
- ‚≠ê Familiarity with hash functions
- ‚≠ê Knowledge of symmetric encryption

**Not required:**
- ‚ùå Advanced math (we explain as we go!)
- ‚ùå Prior ZK experience
- ‚ùå Deep cryptography background

## üéì Learning Tips

1. **Don't rush**: These concepts build on each other. Take your time!

2. **Try the examples**: The documents include mock code examples. Try implementing them!

3. **Read the actual code**: After reading each document, look at the referenced files in the codebase.

4. **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, that's normal! These are complex topics.

5. **Draw diagrams**: Visualizing the flows (keys, notes, proofs) really helps.

## üåü What Makes This Different?

These documents were created by:
- ‚úÖ Reading the **actual Penumbra codebase**
- ‚úÖ Analyzing **real implementations**, not just theory
- ‚úÖ Tracing **concrete code paths** through the system
- ‚úÖ Including **real file locations** and **line numbers**
- ‚úÖ Using **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)** style

**Everything here is grounded in the actual code you'll work with!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **These are learning documents**, not official specifications
2. **Always verify against the actual code** - code is the source of truth
3. **Cryptography is hard** - these simplifications help learning but aren't cryptographically rigorous
4. **Security-critical code** should be reviewed by cryptography experts
