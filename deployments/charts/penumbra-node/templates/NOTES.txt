Penumbra full node config has been deployed!
{{- $count := (.Values.nodes | len | int) }}
Total count of fullnodes: {{ $count }}
{{ if .Values.ingressRoute.enabled }}
You can access the pd gRPC service here:

  https://{{.Values.ingressRoute.hosts.pd }}

You can access the CometBFT RPC service here:

  https://{{.Values.ingressRoute.hosts.tm }}

To check progress on synchronizing with the latest transactions on chain,
run this command locally:

  curl -s https://{{ .Values.ingressRoute.hosts.tm }}/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up

{{- else }}
You have not enabled an ingress (via `ingressRoute.enabled=true`),
so consult the logs to ensure that CometBFT is processing blocks
to catch up with the network. Even without an HTTPS ingress,
your node is still able to interact with the network.
{{- end }}
